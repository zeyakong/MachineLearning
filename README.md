# About this repository
This repository contains all of the assignemnts' source code for the machine learning and AI courses by Dr. Allen [Website](https://cs.uwlax.edu/~mallen/).  
Those two courses covered some contents from Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" book.[example code for the book](sss).  
I used Java to implement most of the assignments. For the CNN assignment, I use Python to run the Keras package in Jupyter NoteBook in our CS lab volta machine.
## Artificial Intelligence  
### A* Search
Input two cities' name, the program will output the shortest path by using A* search.(Java)
### CSP Search
A program for backtracking CSP search.(Java)
### Probability: Bayes Network
Using the enumerative query algorithm.(Java)
### Iterative Policy Evaluation(dynamic programming)
The program will use Java to implement the dynamic programming methods shown in class (iterative policy evaluation and update) to generate an optimal policy for the agent, where we define this as: the shortest path from the starting location to the set of n target objects of largest value, where n is the minimum of carrying capacity c and the total number of targets.
### QLearning and SARSA (in Policy/off Policy)
The basic Java implmentation for Q Learning and SARSA.
## Machine Learning
### Decision Tree
In this assignment, I implemented the Decision Tree learning algorithm by using a data-set that includes mushroom records drawn from the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981) by Java. 
### KD Tree
In this assignment, I implemented the algorithm for constructing K-D trees by Java, and then find the neighbor sets for some data, along with the nearest neighbor in that set.
### Deep Learning(a simple neural network)
Build a multiple layer neural network by Java. The code will allow the user to specify the structure of one or more multi-layer feed-forward networks, and then will train those networks by back-propagation. As the tool is meant to allow a user to explore different possible data-sets and structures, it will be possible to do this process over and over again, as many times as the user chooses. The tool will also allow trained networks be saved to files and loaded again for later re-use.
### Using Keras for CNN
Use the keras package to build a CNN to solve the CIFAR-10 problem.
### Q Learning and feature-Q Learning
Improving the Q learning and build a feature-Q learning by Java.
