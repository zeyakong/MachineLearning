It is very interesting work I think. When I was programming and I just changed some parameters, it will output a very interesting result. It seems the agant has the sentiment.
I think I implement both algorithms successfully and it shows the different answers each time.

This folder has 5 files/folders.

[1]folder src: all the src code. I just write the Q Learning and SARSA in one class(called LearnUtil) and a class called Start is the entrance of the software.

[2]text-file all episodes.txt: A text-file consisting of the best policies found after each 100 episodes (for a total of 20policies), along with the episode number, for each algorithm.

[3]text-file rewards: A text-file consisting of the reward gained for each of the 2000 episodes, for each algorithm.

[4]graph.PDF: accroding to the [3], I just output the information in diagrams. It shows some different between the SARSA and Q.

[5]text-file README.txt:just this.
